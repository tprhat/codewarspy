# The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or
# list of integers:
# max_sequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]) should be 6: [4, -1, 2, 1]
# Easy case is when the list is made up of
# only positive numbers and the maximum sum is the sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative
# numbers, return 0 instead.
# Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty list or array is also a valid
# sublist/subarray.

def max_sequence(arr):
    best_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    for x in arr:
        current_sum = max(0, current_sum + x)
        best_sum = max(best_sum, current_sum)
    return best_sum
